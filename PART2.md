## Why does the traffic light stay on green if the button is not pressed? Does the design make sense?
One of the main requirements of this traffic lights is that "it remains in green until the pedestrian button
is pressed." This design makes sense as, especially in more traffic heavy areas, cars spend more time crossing an intersection than pedestrians. If the traffic light was not green most of the time, the intersection will begin to back up, frustrating drivers.

## What is the safest initial state for the traffic light?
The safest initial state for this traffic light would be the red state. Suppose that during initialization the traffic light crashes and never proceeds beyond the red state. While this might be an inconvenience to the drivers, a constantly red light might be an indication for the drivers to treat the light as a stop sign.

## What components would you add to your design if you wanted to make it safe for people with audition or visual impairments?
While the buzzer is a valid option for providing a cue for visually impared pedestrians, people with auditory impairments might have issues hearing the buzzer, especially if it is too quiet. A possible solution to this is to provide some display component that can be used to indicate when it safe to cross. Modern traffic intersections provide clear visual icons to achieve this.
